# Maze generator and pathfinding tool

This project visualizes maze generation algorithms (such as Depth-First-Search, randomized grid) and allows to apply pathfinding algorithms (such as Breadth-First-Search,
Depth-First-Seach, Dijkstra, A-star) and see shortest path visualizations.

This project was created with React 17. For styling used [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page) component library 
for Bootstrap, and applied [Bootswatch Quartz](https://bootswatch.com/quartz/) theme.
